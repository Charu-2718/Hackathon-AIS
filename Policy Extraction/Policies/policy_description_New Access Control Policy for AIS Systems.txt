Introducing
Country-based Access Control
We have
activated a policy to block access attempts to our M365/Azure and SSO-based
systems from countries outside India (unless a policy exception request has
been submitted and approved). 
 

Access to AIS laptops and
     resources like Teams, Outlook, Onedrive, Sharepoint, Visual Studio, etc
     will be allowed only if the employee is working from India.
For the purpose of account safety and security, AIS has
     implemented a policy wherein, if the employee is logging into AIS
     resources outside India, then their login will be blocked. Access to all
     AIS resources will be blocked. 
Employee must get prior
     approval from Reporting Manager & HR before moving out of India for
     any reason, either for vacation or permanent residency outside India.
Employee must connect with the
     IT Team and take Policy Exception approval before moving out of India for
     any reason. 
If you are currently working
     outside India, but are unaware of this policy, please connect with the IT
     team immediately, at IDCHelp@ais.com.
