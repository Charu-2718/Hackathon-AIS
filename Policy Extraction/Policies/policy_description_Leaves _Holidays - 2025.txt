Leaves & HolidaysAll full-time employees are eligible for 10 days of paid holidays and 18
days of casual leave.In an effort to make the system more flexible and to clear any existing
issues w.r.t holidays, it has been decided not to track holidays separately but
to merge with the paid Time Off. In essence, hours equivalent to holidays would
be credited to the employees’ monthly leave balance. W.e.f. Jan 2019, the
monthly hours credited to your leave balance would be 19 hours (9.5 hours will
be added biweekly in Unanet) which includes paid Time Off & holiday hours.
Please track your leave balance
only in Unanet.Going forward employees need to log their hours in PTO for any public
holiday/festivals, they would like to avail of. For reference purposes, we have
updated a holiday list in ERMS, on which the offices will remain closed.Planned Leave:
Employees should raise Leave requests to the
     corresponding Reporting Manager before taking leave and get it approved.
Inform clients/onsite team members
     through email about your leave of absence and CC Project Manager.
Employees must inform their reporting
     manager about their leave. 
Employees must log their hours in PTO
     when they are on leaveEmployees must record their PTO against LWOP when they don't have a PTO balance available in Unanet and it will be unpaid.·   Unplanned Leave:
In case of unplanned leave, call/text the
     manager or HR to inform them.
Any unscheduled leave that exceeds 2 workdays,
     needs to be validated with medical records etc.,

first 20 days of joining it will be unpaid leave.
