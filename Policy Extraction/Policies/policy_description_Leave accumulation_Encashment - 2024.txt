Effective 1st Oct 2020, accumulation of PTO stops when employee bucket reaches 200 hours.  To help through transition, employees are encouraged to evaluate their balances & claim reimbursement monthly. Employees are allowed
to raise Leave encashment request for maximum 40 hours per month but there is
also a 20 hours encashment option provided. Feel free to discuss with HR
(Mona) if required.Encashment:
* Unanet does not
have this functionality - we are introducing an MS form to request leave
encashment.  * HR will share the MS form link on the 1st or 2nd of every month and the window will close on the 20th of the respective month.  If you raise the request this month, Amount will be paid during OT/Reimbursement cycle next month.* Only one Leave encashment request can be raised
by employee per month
* 40 hours is the
max encashment allowed per month. 
* Against the 10%
overhead earlier (straight hours will be deducted).

leave balance is < 100Hrs, any OT hours will be added to comp-off.*Employees who have their leave balance between 100
Hrs to 120 Hrs can only claim 20 Hours of encashment.*After deducting your claimed hours that is 40/20 your bucket should have 100 as balance compulsorily
